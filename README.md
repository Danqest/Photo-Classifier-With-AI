# Photo Organizer with Artificial Intelligene  

This project is a group effort in creating an application primarily using the MERN stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJs) along with GraphQL. The purpose of this application is to create and deploy an artificial intelligence using deep learning and transfer learning, the reuse of a prior-trained deep learning model with domain knowledge, in order to function as an image classifier. The project uses an MNIST dataset which contains many 28x28ps images of handwritten digits to demonstrate the image classification task where the images are categorized as digits 0-9 with substantial accuracy. 

The classification functionality then has a web-application being built up around to serve as a general image classifier; pre-set categories are defined by the user and sample images of each category are fed to the model, which then in turn is given the task of sorting unorganized images. The application is being built to incorporate storage in the Mongo database with a React frontend and a Node/Express backend. Users are capable of registering and creating accounts and defining their own classification models to train.
